Advent of Code Day 1 - Calculates the total fuel required to lift a launch a (very large) rocket (C++)  

https://adventofcode.com/

Calculates the total fuel required to launch a rocket with a large number of modules, taking into account the mass of the fuel.
The masses of all modules (which are unique to each player) are provided in Module-Masses.txt, included in the repository.

Uses a simple formula for the mass of fuel: mass of fuel = mass of module / 3 - 2  
This is then repeated to calculate the fuel required to lift the fuel added so far. Any mass that would require negative fuel is treated as requiring zero fuel.  

The answer is found to be 4891620, which has been submitted and is correct.
